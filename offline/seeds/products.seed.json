        "description": "SOLDIER FIVE is an elite soldier's explosive memoir of his time within the Special Air Service (SAS) and, in particular, his experiences during the 1991 Gulf War. As a member of the Special Forces patrol now famously known by its call sign Bravo Two Zero, he and seven others were inserted hundreds of kilometres behind enemy lines. Their mission to reconnoitre targets, undertake surveillance of Scud missil sites and sabotage Iraqi communications links was to end in desperate failure.From the outset, the patrol was dogged by problems that contributed both directly and indirectly to the demise of the mission. The patrol's compromise, and subsequent attempts to evade Iraqi troops, resulted in four members of Bravo Two Zero being captured and a further three killed. One escaped. But the story goes further that the Gulf War itself. Despite numerous books, films and articles on the same subject, the British Government has done its utmost to thwart the release of SOLDIER FIVE, at one stage claiming the book in its entirety was confidential. A campaign of harassment that took some four and a half years of litigation to resolve has now resulted in this controversial publication. SOLDIER FIVE is a gripping and suspenseful account of one man's experiences as a Special Forces soldier. Revealing his conflicts and loyalties, and the relationships he forged both on and off the battlefield, this book is the resolution of a soldier's determined fight to see his story told.",

One day, they had a meeting to end a dispute over drug money. Thinking he could scare his rival into submission, Moran pulled the trigger on Carl but decided not to finish the job off. It turned out to be the biggest mistake of his life.  Carl was hell bent on revenge. Within months, most of the Moran family and a host of underworld figures would die in an astonishing spate of revenge killings which shook the public and the police to the core. Murder, greed, drugs, sex and corruption abound in a story that reads like a piece of gangster fiction. But in Underbelly, the bullets and the blood are grippingly real.  This is true crime of the highest order - the amazing story of a powerful man who did things his way and eventually orchestrated his own terrible downfall.",

From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history. Throughout this book, Harris argues that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow, and that how we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the quality of our lives. Waking Up is part memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris--a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic--could write it.",

But where do they come from? What kind of environment breeds them? What sparks the flash of brilliance? How do we generate the breakthrough technologies that push forward our lives, our society, our culture? Steven Johnson's answers are revelatory as he identifies the seven key patterns behind genuine innovation, and traces them across time and disciplines. From Darwin and Freud to the halls of Google and Apple, Johnson investigates the innovation hubs throughout modern time and pulls out the approaches and commonalities that seem to appear at moments of originality.",

The explosion of advanced technologies now means that suddenly knowledge pools and resources have connected all over the planet, levelling the playing field as never before, so that each of us is potentially an equal - and competitor - of the other. The rules of the game have changed forever - but does this 'death of distance', which requires us all to run faster in order to stay in the same place, mean the world has got too small and too flat too fast for us to adjust? Friedman brilliantly demystifies the exciting, often bewildering, global scene unfolding before our eyes, one which we sense but barely yet understand. The World is Flat is the most timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and its discontents, powerfully illuminated by a world-class writer.",

The Brady Bunch show first went on air in 1974 and has continued to broadcast in reruns. A touchstone of American popular culture and a pure example of classic TV, it has been reincarnated in the blockbuster movies, The Brady Bunch Movie and A Very Brady Sequel.. The show's format is perfect for scripting \"life lessons\" and in-jokes. Each episode dealt with some aspect of life that, in 30 minutes, was neatly resolved, complete with an important moral.. This Miniature Edition is a perfect slice of nostalgia for anyone who enjoys the occasional rerun of a TV classic. It includes hilarious and very Brady tips on how to deal with siblings, conquer pre-teen angst and generally be an all-round balanced person.",

Now he revisits America and the people who have most fascinated him to try to discover what motivates them, why they believe the things they believe, and to find out what has happened to them since he last saw them. Along the way Louis thinks about what drives him to spend so much time among weird people, and considers whether he's learned anything about himself in the course of ten years working with them. Has he manipulated the people he's interviewed, or have they manipulated him? From his Las Vegas base, Louis revisits the assorted dreamers and outlaws who have been his TV feeding ground. Attempting to understand a little about himself and the workings of his own mind, Louis considers questions such as: What is the difference between pathology and 'normal' weirdness? Is there something particularly weird about Americans? What does it mean to be weird, or 'to be yourself'? And do we choose our beliefs or do our beliefs choose us?",

In 'A Touch of Class', he tries to attract a better class of hotel guest; while in 'The Builders', he hires O'Reilly's men to carry out some maintenance - but is the cheapest option really the best? In 'The Wedding Party', he suspects hanky panky when an unmarried couple request a double room; and in 'The Hotel Inspectors', Basil is horrified when he realises he needs to be polite to the guests in case one of them is an undercover inspector. 'Gourmet Night' sees him organising an evening of fine dining - but will new chef Kurt be able to cope? And in 'The Germans', Basil struggles not to cause offence to a party of German guests. As long as he doesn't mention the war...   John Cleese stars as Basil Fawlty, with Prunella Scales as Sybil, Connie Booth as Polly and Andrew Sachs as Manuel.",

It relates three interwoven stories: how information lost its body, that is, how it came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material forms that carry it; the cultural and technological constuction of the cyborg; and the dismantling of the humanist \"subject\" in cybernetic discourse, along with the emergence of the \"posthuman\". Ranging across the history of technology, cultural studies and literary criticism, the text shows what had erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. The author moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel \"Limbo\" by Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems.",

Now, the Gallaghers and friends (and enemies) have put pen to paper to bring you the ultimate lifestyle guide. Frank passes on his unique thoughts about the trials of parenting. Sheila gets down and dirty with How Clean is Your Council House? Debbie shares some of her favourite recipes and nutritional tips in a \"Shameless\" version of \"You Are What You Eat\". Ian gives us his gay guide to the Chatsworth Estate. And, of course, the Gallaghers together share their knowledge of how to throw a great party...Award-winning writer Paul Abbott has created the perfect companion to one of Britain's best loved dramas. If you can't get enough of the Chatworth Estate's favourite family, this is the book for you.",

Once again, Tony Hancock stars as the loveable curmudgeon, in four original television soundtracks written by the character's creators, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. In \"The Economy Drive\", Hancock returns home from holiday to find that Sid has left the TV and all the lights on, and failed to cancel the milk and the papers. It's time to make some cutbacks, while \"The Cold\" sees Hancock trying to find a cure for a winter cold, but not even his doctor can help. In \"The Emigrant\", Hancock decides he's had enough of England, and decides to emigrate - even though none of the colonies seem keen to have him, while \"The Baby Sitters\" finds Hancock and Sid employed as baby sitters in a plush, modern house with all the gadgets. But after raiding the host's larder and drinks cabinet the two of them fall asleep. Only when the parents return do they realise there's been a burglary...Featuring a cast including Sid James, Arthur Mullard and John Le Mesurier, these four episodes show the master of misery at his very best.",

Found in a trunk amongst a pile of Hotspur comics, it belonged to Private Pike and features his handwritten marginal notes on the text plus his personal jottings on matters of rather less importance than the defence of the realm, such as films he has seen, girls he has dated and the progress of Aston Villa FC. The book bears the official crest and stamp of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, to which the platoon belongs. Although aged and covered with stains, boot prints, tears and scorch marks, it is in a reasonable condition for facsimile printing. The manual is Capt Mainwaring's attempt to ready the platoon to face (and recognize) the enemy in the coming invasion of Britain.",

Jaynes dispels the imaginary distinction between 'probability theory' and 'statistical inference', leaving a logical unity and simplicity, which provides greater technical power and flexibility in applications. This book goes beyond the conventional mathematics of probability theory, viewing the subject in a wider context. New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary.",

But first he had to write it. And as 2014's Minnesota Teacher of the Year, Rademacher knows what he's talking about. Less a how-to manual than a tribute to an impossible and impossibly rewarding profession, It Won't Be Easy captures the experience of teaching in all its messy glory.The book follows a year of teaching, with each chapter tackling a different aspect of the job. Pulling no punches (and resisting no punch lines), he writes about establishing yourself in a new building; teaching meaningful classes, keeping students a priority; investigating how race, gender, and identity affect your work; and why it's a good idea to keep an extra pair of pants at school. Along the way he answers the inevitable and the unanticipated questions, from what to do with Google to how to tell if you're really a terrible teacher, to why \"Keep your head down\"might well be the worst advice for a new teacher.Though directed at prospective and newer teachers, It Won't Be Easy is mercifully short on jargon and long on practical wisdom, accessible to anyone-teacher, student, parent, pundit-who is interested in a behind-the-curtain look at teaching and willing to understand that, while there are no simple answers, there is power in learning to ask the right questions.",

Barringer shows how using what we know about learning variation with a focus on discovering learning strengths, not just deficits, can help schools create plans for success for those students who often find it elusive. The book specifically addresses how school leaders can incorporate this knowledge into instructional practice and school-level policy through various professional development strategies.  Schools for All Kinds of Minds: * Provides a readable synthesis of the latest research from neuroscience, cognitive science, and child and adolescent development as it relates to understanding learning and its many variations. * Links this information to strategies for understanding struggling learners and adapting school practices to accommodate a wider array of learning differences in a classroom.",

Topics covered include how to shift staff culture to embed great practice, helping children own their own learning, effective use of learning objectives, working well with parents and using AfL to demonstrate pupils' progress. Too often, valuable teacher time is spent on the kind of marking that makes little difference to progress.

In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural world in the twentieth.  Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new \"behavioral futures markets,\" where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold, and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new \"means of behavioral modification.\"  The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a \"Big Other\" operating in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled \"hive\" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for maximum profit -- at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human future.  With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital future -- if we let it.",

I used my Mom's guavas and it came out wonderfully smooth and creamy. The fresh guava is subtle and fragrant. I am actually not missing the heavy cream I would usually be using. The recipes run the gamut from classic favorites (Mint Chocolate Chip) to intriguing, mind-bending combinations (Carrot Apple Coconut Curry). It is more than an ice cream cookbook. It it a passionate treatise on taking ice cream making to the level of a grand adventure. I wonder how many ice cream machines were sacrificed testing these more than 100 recipes. I will definitely be trying more soon. I have my eye on the lilikoi frozen yogurt recipe next since I have so many lilikoi right now. -Dorothy Arriola Colby This recipe book contains 15 chapters and an Index for a total of 208 pages. In the last chapter it contains the topic of TROUBLE SHOOTING. I'd welcome seeing that in any cookbook I buy and use. For the most part, I stay out of the kitchen. So I should probably stay out of the kitchen for sure. But these recipes for ice cream are fascinating, and the many pictures entice the reader into trying something new and different. Who are the readers of this book? Readers who are tired of ordinary ice cream, who have dietary problems that require different ingredients, or who are searching for a new experience in ice cream eating. For those readers I recommend this book. In the first chapters, you'll learn the difference between ice cream, sherbet, sorbet, granita, and frozen yogurt. The author then introduces you to the various kinds of milk you may want to try-coconut, soy, grain milks and the ingredients you may want to mix with the milk. You'll need fats, starches, sweeteners, agave nectar, maple syrup and others. And to insure edible results you'll need the right equipment in your kitchen. This can be as simple or as elaborate as you care to make it. And of course, you'll find dozens of recipes to tempt you. My advice is to read the book through carefully before you begin trying a recipe. Each success will lead to another. This book is a winner.

        "description": "Japan's worst nuclear radiation accident took place at a uranium reprocessing facility in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo, on 30 September 1999. The direct cause of the accident was cited as the depositing of a uranyl nitrate solution--containing about 16.6 kg of uranium, which exceeded the critical mass--into a precipitation tank. Three workers were exposed to extreme doses of radiation. Hiroshi Ouchi, one of these workers, was transferred to the University of Tokyo Hospital Emergency Room, three days after the accident. Dr. Maekawa and his staff initially thought that Ouchi looked relatively well for a person exposed to such radiation levels. He could talk, and only his right hand was a little swollen with redness. However, his condition gradually weakened as the radioactivity broke down the chromosomes in his cells. The doctors were at a loss as to what to do. There were very few precedents and proven medical treatments for the victims of radiation poisoning. Less than 20 nuclear accidents had occurred in the world to that point, and most of those happened 30 years ago. This book documents the following 83 days of treatment until his passing, with detailed descriptions and explanations of the radiation poisoning.",

In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietics have deemed a plant based diet healthy at any age, including throughout infancy. Although, just as when weaning your baby with any other diet, you'll need to be very strict with what you feed your baby to insure he/she is of perfect health. You need to be careful to not exclude nutrients only found in certain foods, in particularly, you should try to incorporate foods with vitamin D, calcium and vitamin B12, as these nutrients are primarily only found in animal foods. Just like with any diet. It will take patience, and trial and error to perfect.

In this analysis of the natural sciences, with a particular focus on the experimental process itself, Roy Bhaskar provides a definitive critique of the traditional, positivist conception of science and stakes out an alternative, realist position. Since it original publication in 1975, a movement known as 'Critical Realism', which is both intellectually diverse and international in scope, has developed on the basis of key concepts outlined in the text. The book has been hailed in many quarters as a 'Copernican Revolution' in the study of the nature of science, and the implications of its account have been far-reaching for many fields of the humanities and social sciences.",

        "description": "This book is written by the authors of the acclaimed \"\"Introduction to Rubrics\"\". It has sold over 3,000 in 12 months. There is a major growth of interest in keeping journals or diaries for personal reflection and growth; and as a teaching tool. It will appeal to college faculty, administrators and teachers. One of the most powerful ways to learn, reflect and make sense of our lives is through journal keeping. This book presents the potential uses and benefits of journals for personal and professional development - particularly for those in academic life; and demonstrates journals' potential to foster college students' learning, fluency and voice, and creative thinking. In professional life, a journal helps to organize, prioritize and address the many expectations of a faculty member's or administrator's roles. Journals are effective for developing time management skills, building problem-solving skills, fostering insight, and decreasing stress. Both writing and rereading journal entries allow the journal keeper to document thinking; to track changes and review observations; and to examine assumptions and so gain fresh perspectives and insights over past events. The authors present the background to help readers make an informed decision about the value of journals and to determine whether journals will fit appropriately with their teaching objectives or help manage their personal and professional lives. They offer insights and advice on selecting the format or formats and techniques most appropriate for the reader's purposes.",

Einstein said that the most incredible thing about our universe was that it was comprehensible at all. As Kitty Ferguson explains, Pythagoras had much the same idea - but 2,500 years earlier. Though known by many only for his famous Theorem, in fact the pillars of our scientific tradition - belief that the universe is rational, that there is unity to all things, and that numbers and mathematics are a powerful guide to truth about nature and the cosmos - hark back to the convictions of this legendary scholar. Kitty Ferguson brilliantly evokes Pythagoras' ancient world of, showing how ideas spread in antiquity, and chronicles the incredible influence he and his followers have had on so many extraordinary people in the history of Western thought and science. 'Pythagoras' influence on the ideas, and therefore on the destiny, of the human race was probably greater than that of any single man before or after him' - Arthur Koestler.",
